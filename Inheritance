Examples
public class cylinder extends circle{} //subclass cylinder base class circle
cylinder = new cylinder(1,10) //instance includes instance variable of circle

[Negative example]
public Cylinder(double r,double h){ //constructor
  radius = r; //error. radius is a private instance of circle
  height = h; 
}
INSTEAD YOU SHOULD
public Cylinder(double r,double h){
  super(r); //calling base class constructor
  height = h; //initialise sub class variable
}

Base class reference, subclass instance
Circle smt = cy; //smt reference instance of cylinder
Cylinder other = c; //error. circle instance do not contain height

Abstract class - act as blueprint, cannot be instantiated
Used when all sub classes have something in common
