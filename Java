java primitive types:
int, double, float, char, boolean

Memory allocation
int n1; // memory allocated but not initialised
int n2 = 10; // allocated and initialised
int n3 = n2; // allocated, assigned the value of n2 and initialised. Value does not change even if n2 is modified.

class, instance
String, Scanner, File, Exceptions
Rectangle r; // class reference instance
Rectangle r1 = new Rectangle(10, 20); // r1 memory contains address of instance containing (length 10, width 20)
Rectangle r2 = new Rectangle(5, 10);
Rectangle r3 = r2; // r3 contains address of instance containing (length 5, width 10)

Array of primitive types:
int n;
int[] nums1; // array is not created. Memory is allocated for nums1
  nums1[0] = 10; //error, NullPointerException since nums1 is not referencing an instance
int[] nums2 = new int[3]; //nums2 reference instance with size of 3
  nums2[0] = -1; // nums2[2] is initialised with default value 0
  nums2[1] = 10;
int[] nums3 = nums2; //nums3 contains address of instance which nums2 is referencing
  nums3[0] = 100;// value modified from -1 to 100

Rectangle[] r1;
Rectangle[] r2 = new Rectangle[2]; //null reference. An array of instance created
  r2[0] = new Rectangle(20,10); // r2[0] reference an instance that was created containing length 20 and width 10
  r2[1] = r2[0]; // r2[1] reference
